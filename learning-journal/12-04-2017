## Multiple demands
Trying to become profecient in ES6 and jQuery simultaneously is going to be a challenge.
I'm really puzzled at how someone can learn the two during this course and what constitutes 'profeciency' by the end of the class.

## SMACSS
This design technique/pattern is useful and unique and I feel it will allow me to be organize my projects no matter the CSS framework.
